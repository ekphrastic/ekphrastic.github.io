For I will consider the neighborhood cat, Brownie.    
    
For Brownie will sprawl across the sidewalk, regardless of approaching people or dogs.    

For he sometimes treats us as friend, and trots briskly in greeting.    
    
For he sometimes treats us as stranger, turning his tail to investigate a mystery scent.    
    
For he sometimes treats us as foe, nipping our hands and turning back his ears.   
    
For his marble eyes reflect the dancing tree tops and boundless sky above.    
    
For petite Luna, his adopted feline sister, knows to yield all treats to him.    
    
For he leaps over walls and weaves through gates to get to where he wants to go.    
    
For his coat is coarse yet clean.    
    
For we anticipate our meetings and wistfully think “maybe next time” when we miss him.
