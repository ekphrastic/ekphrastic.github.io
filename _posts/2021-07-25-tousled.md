A drawer full of snakes  
might be easier   
to navigate  
though  
no less terrifying.  
My husband claims  
to know  
each wire’s use—  
so they remain   
for years untouched.  
  
If they were vines,  
they would grow.  
If they were roots  
they would absorb nutrients.  
To me  
they are the machinery  
under the hood  
of my car—  
unknown and elusive.  
  
If they were thread,  
I would sew something new  
and wrap   
my creation  
with a tousle   
of ribbon  
for joy  
and a wild aesthetic.  
  
If they were lockets  
of hair,   
each would be a memory  
of someone dear.  
Instead, it reminds  
me of my single trip  
to the hardware store  
where I stood feigning  
surety  
among one hundred boxes  
of screws.  
  
If they were noodles,  
I would slurp them to my  
satisfaction.  
If they were worms,  
they would eat  
and burrow  
and shit  
new purpose.  
  
If this drawer were a game   
of shoots and ladders,  
the children would laugh  
and play.  
  
Soon it will be two drawers  
as technology favors change  
over recycling.  
And so  
  
we have appointed  
a drawer  
to serve  
as the holder  
of wires.  
Eached wrapped  
and ready.  
Someday  
a hero  
will invent  
one wire  
to do the work  
of them all.
