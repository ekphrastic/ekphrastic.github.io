Our silicone friend,    
like a hat for a flower,    
keeps my nipples perky and firm    
just as you like it.    
    
I was instructed to "wean" you,    
but you didn't get the memo    
and are more stubborn than I.    
You move my hand more than I yours.    
    
And anyway, giving us both compassion    
and space    
is necessary in these early days.    
    
As long as you grow and are loved    
we will move through these seasons together.
